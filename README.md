# MovieGenreBudget
I've been watching a lot of movies (old, modern, US, international) lately during quarantine, and I noticed drastic differences in resolution quality, costume, special effects, location, etc.

I was curious as to how much it cost to make movies back then versus now, and how this also might vary by country!

It's often been said that USA is the star of the film industry in nearly all genres, so let's see if that's true based on how their movie budgets compare by other leading countries!
